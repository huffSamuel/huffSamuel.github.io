            <p>
            I am a full-stack software engineer building systems that benefit businesses and their customers. Check out some of my personal work in <strong><a href="/projects">projects</a></strong> or scroll down to see my <strong><a href="#cv">CV</a></strong>.

            <p>
            When I'm not at work I'm usually found spending time with my amazing family or out in the garage working on our cars. When you have a career in front of a screen it can be nice to disconnect and work on something in the physical world.
