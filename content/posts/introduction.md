Hello! Welcome to my blog, such as it is. I don't do a lot of posting on here; my life just doesn't end up resulting in a lot of time to sit down and jot down my thoughts for other people online to read. <!--more-->

Occasionally you'll find some interesting content on here though (or at least, I hope you find it interesting). I'm a software engineer, so a lot of the things that end up getting posted here will be relevant to software development, lifecycle, and architecture. I don't claim to be a foremost authority on everything software but the lessons I learn and record here have definitely helped me in my career.

The hobby I spend the most time in is off-roading. And I own a Jeep Cherokee. So, this means I spend a lot of time fixing or upgrading things. You'll find a lot of posts on here that are "how-tos" for these various projects. I hope you at least find it interesting.

Thanks for visiting. Come back again soon!
